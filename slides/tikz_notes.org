Notes based on TikZ tutorial on YouTube @ rivervalleyTV

There are optional tikz libraries which you can include in your TeX document. 
This seems similar to Diagrams, where there is a main Prelude that includes almost everything.

You have both polar and cartesian coordinates. Coordinates, explicit, named , calculated 
or otherwise are chained together with path operations to draw graphics. 

The path operation -- is used to draw lines. 

\draw (1,0) -- (0,1) -- (-1,0) -- (0,-1) -- cycle;

You can also specify various options in square brackets to draw

grids, 
rectangles
cuircles, 
ellipses,
arcs, 
bezier cuves

These are all path operations which re inbuilt. 


How do you name coordiantes? 

\coordinate (origin) at (0 : 0);
\cordinate  (A)  at at (blah: blah)

\draw (A) -- (B) -- ...... -- cycle;

TikZ also has its own iteration mechanism. 
The foreach package can also be used for non TilZ
iterations in TeX. Yay! 

\foreach macro. 


\foreach \i in {0,...,6}

Nodes are coordinates with text and shape. This is critical for 
computational geometry!


\node (v0) at (0,0) [draw, circle] {$v_0$}

the Math engine can be used outside TikZ, just like
the iteration mechanism. 

Many functions, mod, max, min, sin, asun, acos, < == > 
Arithmetic operators. Curly braces tell TikZ that we are referring to 
mathemticas.  To perform coordinate calculations, the calc library
is required, \usetikzlibrary{calc}, i.e. manipulating them 
like vectors. 


You also have the let operation which allows coordinates
to be defined that are available for just oe path. This shines
in calculations. 

There is a function called veclength which does distance 
calculations for you. let syntax aso allows you to extract x and y 
components. 


TikZ can also intersections between two line and a line, a circle and a line
and two circles. You can also embed tikz pictures inline, as you are 
writing a sentnece. 


There are seveal tikz add on libraries. See tkz-2d.

GeoGebra could export to TikZ a long while backGeoGebra could export 
to TikZ a long while back. 

Geogebra can also export to Beamer format. TikZ is not 
particularly strong in data-visualization, but there is a 
package which can take matlab plots and produce TuikZ codes.

There are many packages and programs which TikZ as a springboard.
